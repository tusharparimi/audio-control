# audio-control
This project started as a way to control the media like youtube video being played on my laptop using voice commands from my bluetooth headphones mic.
As my headphones only provided me buttons for play/pause or next/prev video.
I wanted the forward and backward feature we have in youtube(arrow keys). 
Which is essesntial for me while listening to long form media like podcasts and being away from the laptop.
